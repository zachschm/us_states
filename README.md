States matching game | Python | Pandas | Turtle

In this project I developed my skills using the Pandas library. Pandas’ library blew me away and I was amazed on how useful and handy the library is. As a C++ native, inputting and outputting graphical and or tabular data can be very tedious. Pandas seriously makes it so simple to not only input and output tabular data but to easily input, output, and change forms of any data and any data types. The power of the Pandas’ library seems quite extraordinary. In this project, I learned the basics of Pandas’ two main types of data: Series and DataFrames. Series are powerful data types for one-dimensional data while DataFrames are used for multi-dimensional data. In this project, the focus was on DataFrames; I was able to learn the initializing, filling, indexing, and outputting of DataFrames. With my extended experience in indexing multidimensional arrays within C++, Pandas’ methods were very fun to learn and implement. The idea of this program is a U.S. states guessing game which fills in properly guessed states in their correct position on the map. Pandas comes into play as we read in a csv file which contains all 50 states, as well as their x and y coordinates on the U. S. map. The program first validates user input and then compares them to the Pandas DataFrame using Panda indexing syntax and methods. This was a great project and I look forward to working with Pandas and more amazing Python libraries in the future.
